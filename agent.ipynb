    "Balance Your Investment: If you spend early picks on RBs, focus on WRs and Flex positions in the mid-rounds, and vice versa.\n",
    "Practice Mock Drafts: Rehearse different scenarios using mock drafts to prepare for unexpected events during the actual draft.\n",
    "5. Preferred Strategies:\n",
    "\n",
    "Hero RB: Draft one RB and two WRs in the first three rounds, then focus on WRs and TE in Rounds 4-6, and fill out RB/QB in Rounds 7-9.\n",

    "\n",
    "Do: Focus on WR and RB in the first three rounds.\n",
    "Don’t: Take a TE or QB early; avoid using Heavy RB unless there’s exceptional value.\n",
